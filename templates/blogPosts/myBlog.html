              My blog, billyggroves.com is actually the web application that you are on right now. 
              Being a big fan and supporter of podcasts like, Hanselminutes.com, Fragmented, Developer on Fire, etc. 
              All the host have discussed blogging as a developer. 
              Before the idea of blogging just seemed very uninteresting to me. 
              First, I don't really post on social media. 
              I've always been a relatively private person and avoiding talking about myself in most situations. 
              However, the reason that I finally decided to create this blog, 
              was when I heard Scott Hanselman discuss that the reason he has his blog was less about showing others 
              what he is up and more about having a personal reference guide on how to perform certain tasks that he 
              might not remember. This new perspective opened me up to the idea of creating this blog.

            <h2 class="section-heading">Development Process:</h2>
            <p>
              Initially, I considered using a service such as WordPress, Squarespace, or even Go Daddy. 
              However, I quickly decided against this. I wanted to build something myself. 
              Though, I did not want to necessarily reinvent the wheel, however, 
              I felt as though it would give me even more practice and I would learn much more this way.
              <hr>
              It's funny, I didn't really realize, just how much I have learned in the process. 
              I knew I wanted to use Flask, HTML, and jQuery. 
              Not, just because I was most familiar with Flask, 
              but because I knew that it would provide me with security benefits as well as save me a 
              ton of time by limiting the amount of boilerplate code in my HTML files. This would allow 
              me to create future posts more quickly, where I would only have to change text values and 
              maybe add an extra image tag on occasion.
