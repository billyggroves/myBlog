              My blog, billyggroves.com is actually the web application that you are on right now. 
              Being a big fan and supporter of podcasts like, Hanselminutes.com, Fragmented, Developer on Fire, etc. 
              All the host have discussed blogging as a developer. 
              Before the idea of blogging just seemed very uninteresting to me. 
              First, I don't really post on social media. 
              I've always been a relatively private person and avoiding talking about myself in most situations. 
              However, the reason that I finally decided to create this blog, 
              was when I heard Scott Hanselman discuss that the reason he has his blog was less about showing others 
              what he is up and more about having a personal reference guide on how to perform certain tasks that he 
              might not remember. This new perspective opened me up to the idea of creating this blog.

            <h2 class="section-heading">Development Process:</h2>
            <p>
              Initially, I considered using a service such as WordPress, Squarespace, or even Go Daddy. 
              However, I quickly decided against this. I wanted to build something myself. 
              Though, I did not want to necessarily reinvent the wheel. However, 
              I felt as though it would give me even more practice and I would learn much more this way.
              <hr>
              It's funny, I didn't really realize just how much I have learned in the process. 
              I knew I wanted to use Flask, HTML, and jQuery. 
              Not, just because I was most familiar with Flask, 
              but because I knew that it would provide me with security benefits as well as save me a 
              ton of time by limiting the amount of boilerplate code in my HTML files. This would allow 
              me to create future posts more quickly, where I would only have to change text values and 
              maybe add an extra image tag on occasion.
              <hr>
              At first, I had built a WordPress-like blog, where I would have an admin page to log into 
              and it would redirect me to a blog creation page (basically, a page with a bunch of inputs). 
              I then had the database set up to where it would hold all of the content and even the path to 
              the background photo that would all be dynamically updated using Flask and Flask-SQLAlchemy, 
              on a templated post.html file.
              <hr>
              After I had finished this, I soon learned a very important lesson. I then realized that this 
              architecture did not provide me with enough flexibility and freedom I would need to produce 
              the content, that I wanted. So, I ended up scrapping basically all of my project and had to 
              start with the core foundation again. By having to do this, I learned the importance of requirements 
              gathering and production planning. Had I thought out everything before, I would have realized 
              that I wanted more creative freedom, I had root access to the site, and by keeping to blog simple 
              without a database, I will save on my hosting costs.
