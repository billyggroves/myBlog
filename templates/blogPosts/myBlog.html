              My blog, billyggroves.com is actually the web application that you are on right now. 
              Being a big fan and supporter of podcasts like, Hanselminutes.com, Fragmented, Developer on Fire, etc. 
              All the host have discussed blogging as a developer. 
              Before the idea of blogging just seemed very uninteresting to me. 
              First, I don't really post on social media. 
              I've always been a relatively private person and avoiding talking about myself in most situations. 
              However, the reason that I finally decided to create this blog, 
              was when I heard Scott Hanselman discuss that the reason he has his blog was less about showing others 
              what he is up and more about having a personal reference guide on how to perform certain tasks that he 
              might not remember. This new perspective opened me up to the idea of creating this blog.
            </p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">Requirements:</h2>
            <p>
              Initially, I considered using a service such as WordPress, Squarespace, or even Go Daddy. 
              However, I quickly decided against this. I wanted to build something myself. 
              Though, I did not want to necessarily reinvent the wheel, however, I felt as though it 
              would give me even more practice and I would learn much more this way.
              <br>
              It’s funny, I didn’t really realize, just how much I have learned in the process. 
              I knew I wanted to use Flask, HTML, and jQuery. Not, just because I was most familiar with it, 
              but because I know that it would provide me with security benefits as well as save me a ton of 
              time by limiting the amount of boilerplate code in my HTML files. This would allow me to create 
              future posts more quickly, where I would only have to change text values and maybe add an extra 
              image tag on occasion.
              <br>
              At first, I had built a WordPress-like blog, where I would have an admin page to log into and 
              it would redirect me to a blog creation page (basically, a page with a bunch of inputs). 
              I then had the database set up to where it would hold all of the content and even the path 
              to the background photo that would all be dynamically updated using Flask and Flask-SQLAlchemy, 
              on a templated post.html file. 
              <br>
              After I had finished this, I soon learned a very important lesson. 
              I then realized that this architecture did not provide me with enough flexibility and 
              freedom I would need to produce the content, that I wanted. 
              So, I ended up scrapping basically all of my project and had to start with the core foundation again. 
              By having to do this, I learned the importance of requirements gathering and production planning. 
              Had I thought out everything before, I would have realized that I wanted more creative freedom, 
              I had root access to the site, and by keeping the blog more static without a database, 
              I will save on my hosting costs.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2 class="section-heading">Structure:</h2>
            <p>
              The architecture of the blog application is fairly traditional for a Flask-based web application. 
              It contains three main sections. The static folder which contains all the CSS, images, and 
              JavaScript that styles the site. The templates folder, contains all of the HTML files, where the 
              layout.html file is the root file where all other .html files are extended from. 
              It also contains another folder called blogPosts, which contains all of my blog posts. Then last 
              but not least, it contains the app.py file. This is where all the Flask and python code is contained.
              <br>
              <!-- <img src="/static/img/profilePic.jpg" class="rounded-circle"> -->
              <br>
              Inside the static folder is all of the CSS, JS, and images. Since, I currently lack in my design skills, 
              I decided to use a bootstrap template and modify where I see fit. This saved me both time and potentially 
              money through not having to purchase training for designing webpages. Also, since it is a blog website, 
              there really isn’t anything that that I could have designed that would have been unique enough to make 
              it worth my time. There is very little JavaScript right now since I do not have any inputs in my application 
              so far (though I do plan on adding a comment section very soon).  Lastly, the static folder contains, all 
              the images including the back images as well as any image that is contained throughout the entire website.
              <br>
              <!-- <img src="/static/img/profilePic.jpg" class="rounded-circle"> -->
              <br>
              The templates folder contains all my HTML files which stores all the information that I need displayed 
              to the user. With Flask, you generally use one HTML file that contains an abstract template for all of 
              your other HTML files. This is what I have labeled as layout.html file. It contains all the code that 
              would need to be shared under all of my HTML files. By using the feature Flask-JSGlue, with this layout.html 
              file, I saved a significant amount of time and did not have to write near as much boiler plate code, which 
              left me with simple clean code that is easy to read and create.
